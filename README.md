My Thoughts

I am Wangui, Wangui is a common Kikuyu name, Kikuyu is a tribe in Kenya, and Kenya is in Africa.
I've come to realize, unfortunately, that it is important for me to point all this out because of the west-centric world we live in. 

These are my thoughts, writing is thinking. And I'm trying to improve my thinking process and learn how to think or rather improve my thinking.

Take these ideas lightly, or seriosly. I would love to debate on them, or discuss about them or NOTHING!

I'm a young human being, learning more about the world and I just have to say all this is crazy.

But I'm loving it.
