I recently discovered that the Scientific Method has severe limitations. To briefly explore this:

      -  Limited to observable, measurable, and testable phenomena, excluding abstract concepts like morality, aesthetics, or metaphysics.
      -  Subject to researcher biases, human error, and subjective interpretation of data, which can skew results.
      -  Constrained by the capabilities of current technology and ethical considerations, which restrict certain experiments.
      -  Struggles to address complex systems and unique, non-repeatable events due to the reductionist approach and the need for reproducibility.
      -  Conclusions are probabilistic and dependent on current knowledge, which may later be proven incomplete or inaccurate.
      -  Time, resource, and reproducibility challenges limit the scope and reliability of findings.

When our most advanced knowledge discovery system has this much limitations, it offers a bleak outlook to life and to the advancement of our  
understanding of the world as humans. And it means that for us to make more scientific discoveries, we have to come up with a better knowledge  
discovery system than this. I don't see this happening to be honest.

And this led me to other knowledge systems. How do we know what we know? How do we become aware of how we know what we know?
How much of what we don't know harms us? And will we ever recover from this?

With the rise of AI, and increasing channeling of all scientific resources to its advancement means that the rest of the technological and  
scientific areas will be left lagging. So this suggests that we might not know more about the world in the forthcoming future, at least scientifically
